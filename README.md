# **SignboardOCR: Multilingual Signboard Detection and Transliteration**

### **CS725: Foundations of Machine Learning**

This project, developed as part of the CS725 Foundations of Machine Learning (FML) course, implements a custom pipeline for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and transliteration. The system detects text in images of signboards, extracts text regions, recognizes Hindi text, and transliterates it into English using a deep learning-based encoder-decoder architecture.

---

## **Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to build a multilingual OCR pipeline tailored for detecting and processing text on signboards, especially focusing on Hindi text transliteration into English. This system integrates computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) techniques for end-to-end text recognition and translation.

## **Key Components**

### **1. Text Detection**

- **Model**: Faster R-CNN with ResNet-50 backbone.
- **Purpose**: Detect regions of interest (text regions) in signboard images.
- **Details**:
  - Pre-trained on COCO for object detection tasks.
  - Adapted for detecting text boxes in custom signboard datasets.
  - Bounding box coordinates are extracted for subsequent text recognition.

### **2. Text Recognition**

- **Library**: EasyOCR.
- **Purpose**: Recognize text within detected regions.
- **Details**:
  - Supports Hindi (`hi`) and English (`en`) scripts.
  - Used as a lightweight solution for extracting text directly from cropped bounding box images.
  - Recognized text is passed for transliteration if it belongs to the Hindi script.

### **3. Transliteration**

- **Dataset**: [Dakshina Dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/gresearch/dakshina/).
- **Architecture**:
  - **Encoder**:
    - GRU-based sequence encoding.
    - Converts character-level Hindi input to embeddings.
  - **Attention Mechanism**:
    - Bahdanau attention for context-aware transliteration.
  - **Decoder**:
    - GRU-based character-level sequence generation in English.
    - Utilizes teacher forcing during training for improved convergence.

- **Training**:
  - Optimized using `NLLLoss` and Adam optimizers.
  - Trained on ~30 epochs, achieving transliteration accuracy between **85-89%** on the Dakshina test set.

## **System Architecture**

1. **Input**: Image containing multilingual text (e.g., signboards).
2. **Text Detection**: Identify bounding boxes around text regions.
3. **Text Recognition**: Extract Hindi and English text from cropped regions.
4. **Transliteration**: Convert Hindi text to English transliteration.
5. **Output**: Processed text in English with transliterations for Hindi components.
